Persona Dissection

Persona 1: Jarvis Eddison

Jarvis Eddison is a Sales Representative who is motivated to build a stronger connection with his son through video games as it is an interest many kids have in today’s world. While he enjoys games himself, he is unsure which ones would be suitable for his son and how to find games they can play together. If we implement a subscription service on our video game website, he would have access to a wide variety of games to try with his son.

To make finding the right game easier, we could add a feature that indicates whether a game is multiplayer, allowing both father and son to play together and enjoy the experience. Additionally, a Kids Mode, similar to the one on Netflix, could be introduced to filter games that are appropriate for children.

Since his son tends to be picky and loses interest in games quickly, a rating and review system would also be helpful. This feature would allow Eddison to read reviews from other kids and parents, helping him decide whether a game is worth trying with his son.

------------------------------------

Persona 2: Lucinda Murphy

Lucinda Murphy is a full-time student who works part-time as a barista and enjoys playing cozy video games. Due to her minimal student allowance, she must be careful with her spending, which means she can't purchase games as often. She also tends to buy games only to later realize they aren't satisfactory, leading her to ask for a refund. A subscription service would give her access to countless games, removing the financial stress of purchasing each one individually. Additionally, we could offer a first-time user discount, giving her the opportunity to see if the website is something she wants to invest in regularly. Seasonal or holiday discounts could also help alleviate her financial strain.

Murphy often loses interest in games with long completion times, so a filter system could be integrated into the website to help her avoid games that don’t align with her preferences. Since she uses video games to unwind after studying and working, a "game suggestion" feature would help her find cozy games quickly, while also recommending options that fit into her busy schedule. For example, idle games, where progress continues even when she's not actively playing, could be a great fit.

Iteration 1 Progress Report

Althea

Report: Althea participated in our group discussions on what website our project will be about. After finalizing the details (a video game website that offers a subscription service) we discussed our stakeholders making progress on our Stakeholder Register Table. Althea also created one of the three customer personas. Creating persona dissections of my other group members customer personas was the next task Althea also completed.

Personal Reflection: We were able to work together well in discussions during class throughout Iteration 1 but not so much outside of class online on my end. Althea does have trouble with communicating online in general and is something that she would have to improve moving forward. Making continuous progress was also a challenge within our project and is another area that needs to improve with active communication and action.

Lorien

Report: Lorien has contributed her share of the creation of the Stakeholder Register, alongside the creation of a Persona Profile. Lorien also provided personal insight into areas she has experience in, which the team responded well to.

Personal Reflection: Lorien wants to be more assertive within her group so it can achieve more timely results. She has been unwell the past few weeks and feels some guilt for not having contributed as much as she has wanted to. Her team have been great supporters and they have good chemistry.

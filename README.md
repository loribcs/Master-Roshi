<h2>Persona Dissection</h2>


**Persona 1: Jarvis Eddison**


Jarvis Eddison is a Sales Representative who is motivated to build a stronger connection with his son through video games as it is an interest many kids have in today’s world. While he enjoys games himself, he is unsure which ones would be suitable for his son and how to find games they can play together. If we implement a subscription service on our video game website, he would have access to a wide variety of games to try with his son.


To make finding the right game easier, we could add a feature that indicates whether a game is multiplayer, allowing both father and son to play together and enjoy the experience. Additionally, a Kids Mode, similar to the one on Netflix, could be introduced to filter games that are appropriate for children.


Since his son tends to be picky and loses interest in games quickly, a rating and review system would also be helpful. This feature would allow Eddison to read reviews from other kids and parents, helping him decide whether a game is worth trying with his son.


**Persona 2: Lucinda Murphy**


Lucinda Murphy is a full-time student who works part-time as a barista and enjoys playing cozy video games. Due to her minimal student allowance, she must be careful with her spending, which means she can't purchase games as often. She also tends to buy games only to later realize they aren't satisfactory, leading her to ask for a refund. A subscription service would give her access to countless games, removing the financial stress of purchasing each one individually. Additionally, we could offer a first-time user discount, giving her the opportunity to see if the website is something she wants to invest in regularly. Seasonal or holiday discounts could also help alleviate her financial strain.


Murphy often loses interest in games with long completion times, so a filter system could be integrated into the website to help her avoid games that don’t align with her preferences. Since she uses video games to unwind after studying and working, a "game suggestion" feature would help her find cozy games quickly, while also recommending options that fit into her busy schedule. For example, idle games, where progress continues even when she's not actively playing, could be a great fit.


**Persona 3: Cedric Shanzel**


Cedric Shanzel is in an interesting position where his passion for dance and desire to stay in
shape can co-exist and go as far as to intertwine with his love of gaming. This is, because he can take the route of physical / fitness centric video games such as Wii Sports or Kinect Sports. Or, most fittingly, Just Dance. If we were to cater directly to Cedric’s challenges and obstacles, we could consider including a function similar to a blog which outlines all the recent releases and major updates for games across various platforms. This would enable him to read over said details at his own convenience, without needing to risk spoilers due to the relatively vague nature. Additionally, by implementing a “continue playing” (or, downloaded games) section, Cedric would be less likely to lose entire focus on the various games he plays in his free time.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


<h2>Iteration 1 Progress Report</h2>


**Althea**


Report: Althea participated in our group discussions on what website our project will be about. After finalizing the details (a video game website that offers a subscription service) we discussed our stakeholders making progress on our Stakeholder Register Table. Althea also created one of the three customer personas. Creating persona dissections of my other group members customer personas was the next task Althea also completed.


Personal Reflection: We were able to work together well in discussions during class throughout Iteration 1 but not so much outside of class online on my end. Althea does have trouble with communicating online in general and is something that she would have to improve moving forward. Making continuous progress was also a challenge within our project and is another area that needs to improve with active communication and action.


**Lorien**


Report: Lorien has contributed her share of the creation of the Stakeholder Register, alongside the creation of a Persona Profile. Lorien also provided personal insight into areas she has experience in, which the team responded well to.


Personal Reflection: Lorien wants to be more assertive within her group so it can achieve more timely results. She has been unwell the past few weeks and feels some guilt for not having contributed as much as she has wanted to. Her team have been great supporters and they have good chemistry.


**Chloe**


Report: Although progress was slower than Chloe anticipated, she was happy to work with her group and help out where she could. She worked together to complete the stakeholder register, and completed the report herself due to the unwellness and busyness of the rest of the group.


Personal Reflection: She hopes that the group can communicate better moving forward, but has enjoyed working with them in this project so far.

<h2>Gantt Chart</h2>

[Master Roshi "Notion" Task Board](https://www.notion.so/1b99bc6c9b9f800185a5c307eaff468b?v=1b99bc6c9b9f80d5aa82000cfec3e8c1&pvs=4)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<h2>Iteration 2 Progress Report</h2>


**Chloe Cawood**

Chloe feels that her contribution was lackluster moving into the second iteration. While she maintained decent communication, she found herself a little behind on the topics of discussion and intends on being more attentive in classes for her own benefit and in order to contribute more to group discussions moving forward. She is appreciative of her teammates efforts and is eager to better understand the tools being used in order to help furthermore. 


**Althea Lagudas**

Althea’s online communication with her other team members has improved within iteration. When going through the process of creating the Resource Requirements List, Althea communicated with her team digitally if there were requirements that were missing, and if the overall list looked correct. She feels that the overall communication as a team has improved when completing tasks, and is something they must maintain for a steady workflow and to complete tasks on time. When tasked with creating a Gantt chart our team decided to use Notion. With Althea’s lack of familiarity with how to use the application, she was not able to contribute to the task as much as she liked. Moving forward she would need to get more familiar with using Notion to better support her other team members.


**Lorien Gugich**

Lorien's contribution toward this iteration was sufficient. She was more proactive with communication and assertive with tasks. Lorien entered and updated information into the project wiki file, and brainstormed well with her fellow team mates regarding class activities. Lorien is looking forward to this next iteration with her team as they are getting into a better groove.

<h2>Iteration 3 Progress Report</h3>


**Chloe Cawood**

Chloe struggled to begin the tasks required of her to begin with, however, after communication with her teammates, was able to develop a steady footing and was able to complete what was required of her without any further issues. She appreciates the support she has been given, and is doing further research into Git and GitHub in order to offer more to the team. She is happy with her progress thus far and is eager to improve on her skills moving forwards. 


**Althea Lagudas**

Althea maintained consistent communication throughout this iteration while working on the risk register. She continued to engage with her team digitally, asking whether the risks she identified were agreed upon by everyone or if any changes were needed. She also checked to ensure that everyone agreed with the rankings of likelihood, impact, and severity for each risk.
Moving forward, Althea should continue updating her personal branch within the GitHub repository with her completed documents. This will help ensure her team members are aware of what has been completed and what still needs to be done.


**Lorien Gugich**

Lorien Gugich has been updating the project wiki file as needed when new documentation comes in. This iteration she has been working on the assigned tasks and milestones and making sure the information is correct and in the right format for final hand in. This is ongoing.
Lorien reached out to her teammates about getting together before the final project is handed in, so they can organise their files tidily and commit them to the finalized GitHub branch. She looks forward to this.
